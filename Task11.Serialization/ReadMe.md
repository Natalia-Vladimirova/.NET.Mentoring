## Task 11 - Serialization

According to books.xml file create Catalog and Book class structure (use the C # approach to naming of classes and properties in the form of CamelCase and PascalCase).  

Pay attention to the following:
+ a genre should be presented as an enumeration;
+ it should be possible to work with dates as DateTime structures.

Add possibility of serialization and deserialization of classes for books.xml file.
